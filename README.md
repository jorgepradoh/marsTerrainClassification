# Martian Terrain Classification

In this script we will be testing different multi-class classification networks
puting emphasis on the accuracy performance between convolutional and transformer
based neural networks.

We will be using our own dataset containing four classes:
- Bedrock
- Big Rocks
- Gravel
- Sand

The images in this dataset have been obtained from different sources available online.
We have also used data augmentation to balance all classes, having 1k images for each
class.
